# FIELDAQ

## Overview and Resources
The software for the FIELDAQ is written in python, using the kivy library. Versioning is managed using git via GitHub. The layout and functionality are based on the old DARLING software. With the addition of a touchscreen, kivy was utilized over pygame.

- [Resources for Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- Resources for kivy can be found in [Documentation/Kivy Training Resources](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/blob/master/Documentation/Kivy%20Training%20Resources.docx)
  - OR [online](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/index.html)

## Running the Software
After installing python and the nessesary libraries, the software is run by navigating into the [FIELDAQ/Granusoft/src](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/tree/master/Granusoft/src) directory and running the [main.py](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/blob/master/Granusoft/src/main.py) file.

The [main.py](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/blob/master/Granusoft/src/main.py) file imports the necessary kivy library elements, and builds the kivy app. The companion [main.kv](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/blob/master/Granusoft/src/main.kv) file imports the widgets (GUI screen elements), created for the use across the GUI, and imports the views that will be displayed throughout the app. These views are each composed of a python file and kivy file. More detail can be found in [Documentation/Kivy Screen Management.docx](https://github.com/byu-crop-biomechanics-lab/FIELDAQ/blob/master/Documentation/Kivy%20Screen%20Management.docx).

The software is designed to be run on the RaspberryPi, but can also be run on any computer with python3 and kivy. This approach is useful for development and testing purposes. The code is structured to use false sensor input data when the sensor connections can not be properly detected.

## Plans for Future Changes and Improvements
- There are a few GitHub branches of the repository in various states of progress. Their subjects of feature improvements include:
  - Implementing a bar code scanner for naming test files.
  - Adjusting the camera settings
  - Fixing an issue with the image review screens where some images may not appear.
  - Creating a new keyboard layout with a minus sign to be used for text entry in the calibration screens.
- A future redesign of the PCB would be convenient for adjusting port placement on the physical board.
