1. Keep file paths short and sensible.
2. Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
3. Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
4. Make all changes in a branch so that the master branch is only modified by pull requests.
